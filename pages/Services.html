      <h1 id="Dog-Walking">Dog Walking</h1>

      <p class="paragraph-text">Dogs benefit from regular walks. Dog walks provide environmental enrichment, exercise, and an opportunity for social interaction as well as relieving the boredom in their day. Dogs that are not provided enough environmental enrichment can develop behavioural issues and may become destructive, depressed or fearful.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Our Dog Walking Service provides the perfect solution for busy pet guardians with pressing work or family commitments or injured or disabled pet guardians, who aren’t able to walk their pets.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">ScruffyPups n’ GrumpyCats Pet Services can provide your dog with a 30 minute or 45 minute walk. Regular dog walking during the week can be provided. We also recommend our Dog Walking service when booking our Pet Sitting services.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">Our priority is the safety and well-being of your dog. We will only walk dogs from the same ‘family’ together.</p>
      <p class="paragraph-text">ScruffyPups n’ GrumpyCats Pet Services endeavour to make your dog’s walk as stimulating and enjoyable as possible.</p>
      <p class ="paragraph-text">All dog walks include the following:</p>

      <ul class ="paragraph-text walk-list">
        <li>Security – All dogs remain on a leash at all times. We use a long leash at the beach or the park to allow your dog more freedom, whilst ensuring their security. Your dog will never be left unattended and whilst in our care, our focus will be %100 on their safety and well-being.</li>
        <li>Safety – In the interest of your dog’s safety, we will not walk your dog during extreme weather conditions; either extreme heat or thunderstorms. In lieu of walking your dog, we may in consultation with you provide in-home play time, environmental enrichment games and companionship.</li>
        <li>Basic Training – As an experienced dog trainer I am passionate about Pet Dog Training. I can provide some basic training for your dog using ‘Force Free’ methods or ensure that any ‘Force Free’ training you have in place with your dog is practiced and maintained. (I do not and will not use any aversive training methods.)</li>
        <li>Comfort – To ensure your dog is left comfortable after his or her walk, we will check your dog for prickles and grass seeds and remove them or any other debris from their fur and give them a quick brush as necessary. If your dog is wet (from a romp at the beach, or from dew or rain) we will towel dry them.</li>
        <li>Equipment – ScruffyPups n’ GrumpyCats Pet Services provides water bowls, long leashes, poo bags and treats for our dog walks. We also carry with us at all times a Pet First Aid Kit, spare leashes, collars and harnesses, brushes, sunscreen and towels as well as our mobile phone with emergency contact details.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="paragraph-text"><i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> You can pay for 9 Dog Walk services at a time and receive the 10th one free.</p>

      <p>Hi, I'm Colleen.</p>
      <p>Having worked for a large multination corporation for many years I decided it was time to follow my passion working with animals. I have been a volunteer dog trainer for nearly a decade, working with local community organisations to provide affordable training options for pet owners, while also providing education for community members and schools. I continue to volunteer my time to these organisations in the interest of improving the lives of pets and pet owners living in my local community.</p>
      <p>I have a Cert IV in Training and Assessment &amp; Cert II in Animal Care. I am a certified Pet Dog Ambassador Trainer, a member of The Pet Professional Guild and currently completing a Diploma in Canine Behaviour.</p>
